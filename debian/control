Description: binary copy for non-byte-aligend streams
 bdd can extract bit-units from a stream of any byte size.
 Additionally it can skip arbitrary bit amounts and give
 bit fields meaningful interpreations using templates
 including solving big/little endian problems.
 .
 bdd also allows to create arbitrary bit-streams from human
 readable CSV input.
 .
 bdd can also merge two bit streams to one using bit skips.
 .
 bdd is planned to be extremely flexible but it is not very 
 efficient. It is implemented using Python.
